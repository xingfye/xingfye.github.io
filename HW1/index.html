      Hi, my name is Xingfu Ye, I'm from China. Going to a college named Queens college, currently I'm majoring in Graphic Design.

      I love playing video games, not a professional, but good enough to enjoy playing them. I never thought I would taking Webdesign II, because the first one already gets crazy and it was two semester ago, very surprise that I still remember some of the code. And now since I have the courage to enroll this course, I will try my best to.... pass this course.
